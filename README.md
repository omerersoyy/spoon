# spoon

This is an example app that I developed for a company as an interview challange.

I kept things and styles as basic as possible and restrict data in api calls so I could focus on logic and patterns.


- How to run?

cd spoon/spoon
npm install
cd ios
pod install
react-native run-ios/android
